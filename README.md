# RabbitMQ Contributor License Agreement

This repository contains Contributor License Agreement documents.

## Do You Need to Sign the CLA?

If you plan to contribute to RabbitMQ or one of the related projects under [the RabbitMQ GitHub org](https://github.com/rabbitmq),
the answer is **yes, you do**.

If you or **the organization you represent** with your contribution(s) hasn't signed a Broadcom CLA,
you must sign it. This must be done only once per contributor, whether it is an individual or a company.

In other words, if three members from company C plan on contributing, the company has to sign the CLA **just once**,
**not** once per employee.

## How to Submit a CLA

The process involves contacting our team via email, and receiving a signing request from [Box Sign](https://www.box.com/en-gb/esignature),
then digitally signing said request.

1. Contact us via email at `tnz-rabbitmq-core dot pdl </> broadcom dot com`. Use the subject of `Please send a request to sign RabbitMQ CLA`
2. State a preferred email to receive the signing request. It could be the same email address that sends the request.
3. You will receive a signing request with subject starting with `Please Sign:` from a Broadcom email.
4. Follow the link in the document to sign the request. The trusted domain is `broadcom dot box dot com`
