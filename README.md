## Do You Need to Sign the CLA?

If you or **the organization you represent** with your contribution(s) hasn't signed a Broadcom CLA,
you must sign it. This must be done only once per contributor, whether it is an individual or a company.

In other words, if three members from company C plan on contributing, the company has to sign the CLA **just once**,
**not** once per employee.
